# AI_PL_FOL_Inference_PrologCloneProjectAUEB

Resolution Inference Methods for mathematical logic using resolution for Propositional Logic CNF and Horn clauses, as well as the forward chaining method for First Order Logic Horn Clauses, implemented in Java. The First Order Logic forward chaining method implementation tries to imitate an alternative approach to the Prolog Language (which uses backward chaining method). This was written as a project in terms of the subject Artificial Intelligence in AUEB.
